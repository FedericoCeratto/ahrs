Attitude from angular rate
==========================

A quaternion is updated via integration of angular rate measurements of a
gyroscope. The easiest way to update the quaternions is by integrating the
differential equation for a local rotation rate [Sola]_.

In a kinematic system, the angular velocity :math:`\\mathbf{\\omega}` of a
rigid body at any instantaneous time is described with respect to a fixed frame
coinciding instantaneously with its body frame [#]_. Thus, this angular
velocity is *in terms of* the body frame [Jia]_.

The angular rates are measured by local sensors, providing local measurements
:math:`\\omega_t` at discrete times. The differential equation of a quaternion
at time :math:`t` is:

.. math::
    \\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_t = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{q}_t\\mathbf{\\omega}_t

where :math:`\\omega_t` is the measured angular velocity, in radians per
second, at the instant :math:`t`, and represented as a pure quaternion
:math:`\\mathbf{\\omega}=\\begin{bmatrix}0 & \\omega_x & \\omega_y & \\omega_z\\end{bmatrix}`.

At :math:`t+\\Delta t`, the orientation is described by :math:`\\mathbf{q}(t+\\Delta t)`,
after a rotation was performed during :math:`\\Delta t` on the frame. The
simplest assumption is that :math:`\\omega` is constant over the integration
period :math:`\\Delta t`. Thus, making the differential equation **time
invariant** [Trawny]_.

The quickest integration is done performing a `right Riemann sum
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum#Right_Riemann_sum>`_ with the
computed derivative:

.. math::
    \\begin{array}{rcl}
    \\mathbf{q}_{t+1} &=& \\mathbf{q}_t + \\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_t\\Delta t \\\\
    &=& \\mathbf{q}_t + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{q}_t\\mathbf{\\omega}_t\\Delta t
    \\end{array}

The resulting quaternion must be normalized to operate as a
`versor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versor>`_, and to represent a valid
orientation.

.. math::
    \\mathbf{q}_{t+1} \\gets \\frac{\\mathbf{q}_{t+1}}{\\|\\mathbf{q}_{t+1}\\|}

This is the simplest approximation to integrate the quaternions over time. That
will, naturally, yield a drift due to faulty sensors (no sensor is perfect) and
the truncation of the numerical solution.

Integration methods based on the Taylor series and Runge-Kutta can be employed
to increase the accuracy, and are shown to be more effective. See [Sola]_ and
[Zhao]_ for a comparison of the different methods, their accuracy, and their
computational load.
